## **Synthetic Ice Stream**

This example demonstrates synthetic ice stream modeling using various types of ensemble Kalman filters (EnKF, DEnKF, EnTKF, and EnRSKF). You can run the example using one of two methods:

1. **Notebook Interface**: Use the interactive notebook `synthetic_ice_stream_da.ipynb` for a hands-on, exploratory approach.
2. **Terminal Execution** (Recommended for HPC platforms): Use the `run_da_icepack.py` script for high-performance and feature-rich execution.

### **Running with `run_da_icepack.py`**

To execute the `run_da_icepack.py` script, follow these steps:

**Note**: All parameters are centrally managed in the `params.yaml` file for ease of modification and experimentation.

1. **Configure Inputs**:
   - Edit the `params.yaml` file to define your desired inputs and parameters.
   - The script dynamically fetches these parameters using helper functions from the `config` directory.

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python run_da_icepack.py
   ```

3. **Experiment with Filters**:
   - Modify the `filter_type` parameter in the `params.yaml` file to switch between different filters:
     - **EnKF**: Ensemble Kalman Filter
     - **DEnKF**: Deterministic Ensemble Kalman Filter
     - **EnTKF**: Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter
     - **EnRSKF**: Ensemble Square Root Kalman Filter

4. **Outputs**:
   - Results are saved in the `results/` directory as `.h5` files with the naming format:
     ```
     filter_type-model.h5
     ```

5. **Visualize Results**:
   - Use the notebook `read_results.ipynb` to load and plot the results for detailed analysis.

### **Running with Containers**

For containerized environments (e.g., HPC clusters), you can execute the script using Apptainer/Singularity:

1. **Build the Container**:
   - Follow the instructions in the `/src/container/apptainer/` directory to create the container image (`icepack.sif`).

2. **Run the Script in the Container**:
   - Execute the script inside the container:
     ```bash
     apptainer exec icepack.sif python run_da_icepack.py
     ```

---

### **Key Features**

- **Flexible Configuration**: Modify parameters in the `params.yaml` file without changing the script.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for HPC platforms, especially when running via terminal or containers.
- **Container Support**: Easily execute the script in controlled environments using Apptainer/Singularity.
- **Interactive Analysis**: Leverage the Jupyter notebook for visual exploration of results.
