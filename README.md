# Data_assimilation_project
A state-of-the-art data assimilation software package for ice sheet models. This sophisticated software includes the creation of an adaptive intelligent wrapper with protocols and APIs that automatically couple and integrate with various ice sheet models. The goal is to streamline the interaction between different models, making incorporating complex data assimilation techniques easier across multiple frameworks. Additionally, I am working on integrating this design with cloud computing services like AWS, enabling scalability and efficiency for larger simulations. This software will eventually be incorporated into the GHUB online ice sheet platform, expanding its capabilities to include the new features Iâ€™m developing
